    <h3>Key Areas of Cybersecurity</h3><br>
      <p>The field of cybersecurity encompasses several critical areas that work together to provide comprehensive digital protection:</p><br>

      <h4>1. Network Security</h4>
      <p>Network security focuses on protecting the integrity of network infrastructure and data. This includes implementing firewalls, encryption protocols, and secure network architectures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Modern network security also involves continuous monitoring and threat detection to identify and respond to potential security incidents quickly.</p><br>

      <h4>2. Application Security</h4>
      <p>Application security involves implementing measures to enhance the security of applications by finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities. This includes secure coding practices, regular security testing, and implementing security features such as authentication and authorization controls.</p><br>

      <h4>3. Cloud Security</h4>
      <p>As organizations increasingly move their operations to the cloud, cloud security has become crucial. This involves protecting cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and data through specialized security policies, technologies, and controls designed for cloud environments.</p><br>

      <h4>4. Information Security</h4>
      <p>Information security focuses on protecting data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. This includes implementing data encryption, access controls, and backup systems to ensure data is protected both at rest and in transit.</p>
